    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is a way to design algorithms that is extremely powerful when applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem has the following two properties, it can be a good candidate for dynamic programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The optimal substructure – which means an optimal solution to the problem contains the optimal solution to a sub problem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overlapping sub problems – A recursive solution contains a “small” number of distinct sub problems repeated many times\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see these criteria being met in the structure of the recursive algorithm we studied last notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](recursion_tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming has a few important principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- solve (smaller) subproblems first (just once)\n",
    "- store the results of subproblems in memory table\n",
    "- use their solutions to solve bigger and bigger subproblems\n",
    "- Use a bottom-up approach \n",
    "\n",
    "You can remember the bottom-up approach if you've ever tried solving labyrinth puzzles \"backwards\" instead or normally when you were a child (it's much faster!).\n",

    "# Knapsack problem using Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the following setup as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Weights : 2 3 3 4 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Values : 1 2 5 9 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Bag Size : 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at the below table and then I will explain the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](knapsack_table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers in the header row represent maximum allowed weight. This means, if I am looking at the column with header value 0, this means we are solving for maximum allowed weight zero. Similarly if we are looking at the column with header value 7, we are essentially interested in maximum allowed weight 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very first column represents the weights and their values in bracket.  So, if we are looking at row 2, that means the only weights at our disposal is the weight in row 0, 1 and 2. So if I am looking at the row with weight 4(9), that means, we only care about weights 2(1), 3(2), 3(5) and 4(9) and we have not yet considered weight 6(4).\n",
    "\n",
    "### So, what does a cell in the grid represents?\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of a cell (i,j) represents the maximum value we can achieve by choosing from weights w0, w1, .. wi such that the sum of weights is less than or equal to j. IN this grid, the value of cell (3, 6) is 10. This means, if the weight limit of our knapsack is 6 and the items at our disposal are 2(1), 3(2), 3(5) and 4(9), then the maximum value we can get by picking items from this list would be 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more time, cell (4, 10) has the value 16. This means that the maximum value we can get from items 2(1), 3(2), 3(5), 4(9) and 6(4) is 16 within the knapsack’s weight limit of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to populate this grid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first populate the zeroth row of the grid. This row means, if we are given just one weight 2(1) then for each knapsack of weight limit (0 to 10) what is the maximum value we can achieve. For a knapsack of weight limit zero, we cannot put the weight 2(1), hence the value would be 0. Similarly, for the knapsack of weight limit one, we cannot choose this weight, hence the value would still be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for the knapsack of weight limit 2, we can definitely pick the weight 2(1) as this is the only weight available till row zero. Hence we can achieve a maximum value of 1, if we only have weight 2(1) and knapsack of capacity 2. Same argument goes for the remaining cells in the zeroth row. No matter how big the capacity of knapsack is, if the only weight available to us is 2(1), then the maximum value we can achieve is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we move to the first row, it means that we now have two weights at our disposal 2(1) and 3(2). But again, the knapsack of capacity 0\\less than 3 won’t be affected by making this weight available, because we can never pick this weight. So, we can just copy the values for columns zero, one and two. For a knapsack of capacity 3 we can choose to ignore the weight 3(2) or pick it up. The maximum value would be the maximum of these two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose 3(2), then the value would be 2 + the maximum value from the remaining weight (3-3 = 0). So, the maximum value for weight zero is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we ignore the   weight 3(2), then the value would be same as the value in the above row which is 1. Now the maximum of (2, 1) is 2. Hence, the value of cell (1,3) is 2."
